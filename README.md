# Medical Image Classification Keras (Binary classification)
* Download the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
* Store the downloaded dataset in a folder named "DS2" (or you can name whatever you want it, in that case change root folder inside the program accordingly)
* Inside the DS2 folder, put the train dataset into a folder named "train", put the validation data into a folder named "validation", and the test data inside a folder named "test". 
* In this dataset, we have two classes: Normal, and Pneumonia
* The structure of your dataset folder (i.e., DS2) should be as follows:

#DS2
    - train
        -NORMAL
        -PNEUMONIA
    - validation
         -NORMAL
         -PNEUMONIA
    - test
         -NORMAL
         -PNEUMONIA
         
 * Now run the program.
